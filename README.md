👋 Hi there! I'm Tarryn Blom - a Backend Software Engineer with a zest for coding and creativity! 🚀

🌐 What I Do: I weave magic with Ruby, Python, and SQL, and tinker with Django, ASP.Net, Ruby on Rails, and NodeJS. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the vast universe of Kubernetes, Docker, Git, and Jira. I'm all about building efficient systems that not only work but also bring smiles. 😄

🎉 Proudest Moment: I once charmed a million chats with a chatbot I developed for xneelo. Talk about having a chat-tastic impact!

📚 Learning Never Stops: Currently mastering the art of AI, because why not? The future is now, and I'm all geared up!

💡 Fun Fact: When I'm not turning coffee into code, I'm probably lifting team spirits or solving problems in ways you'd least expect. I'm a bit of a mentor, a dash of a leader, and a whole lot of team player!

🔍 Looking For: A place where my backend skills can shine in hybrid/remote roles. I'm ready to dive into new challenges and sprinkle some Tarryn magic!
